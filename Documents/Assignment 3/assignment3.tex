\section{Task 1}
\subsection{Three activities}
\raggedright
Activities are connected using intents. Intents allow new activities to be launched on events that occur in the main activity. Furthermore, data can be passed between the activities if necessary to give the activity context. The main activity in this app, \textit{MainActivity.java} uses intents to launch the other two activites, \textit{HeightActivity.java} and \textit{TempActivity.java}. If the user presses the back button in one of the second two activities they will return to the \textit{MainActivity.java}

\inputminted[firstline=40,lastline=50]{java}{../../Apps/Converters/app/src/main/java/au/net/danielparker/converters/MainActivity.java}

When one of the form-based activity's orientation changes, the \textit{onSaveInstanceState} event is called. By overriding that method, the form data can be saved and then retrieved after the activity is recreated by overriding \textit{onRestoreInstanceState} and restoring that data to the correct views in the activity.

\subsection{Screenshots}
The following two screenshots show how the orientation change doesn't cause the data in the activity to disappear, due to it being passed in the state change bundle and then restored to the activity when it is recreated.

\subsection{Task 2}
In this app, the image and description resource IDs are passed through the intent to the recieving Activity which then sets the resource using those IDs.

\section{Task 3}
\subsection{Why is the intent messaging facility considered as a late run-time binding be- tween components?}
It is considered a late run-time binding because it's not something that gets evaluated when the main app is compiled, but rather something that happens at run-time.

\subsection{What are the contents of the passive data structure (of an intent)?}
The contents of the passive intent are actions and data. Actions are to be performed and the data is the what the action will be performed on / with.

\subsection{Why is the word “passive” used for the intent data structure?}
It means that the data structure doesn't do anything, in the case of intents there is just messages telling some other activity what to do and it's not the Intent's responsibility to do it. It is essentially just a means of messaging other activities.

\subsection{Phone Example}
The intent is constructed with the action to call and the phone number. The intent is then passed into the \textit{startActivity} method as a parameter. The intent is just an abstract representation of the action to call the number.
\begin{minted}{java}
	String number = "5555555555";
	Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CALL);
	intent.setData(Uri.parse(number));
	startActivity(intent);
\end{minted}
